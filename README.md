# frontend-v2

Welcome to the (new) CHORAS frontend!

To run the frontend in your favourite web browser follow these steps:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.
2. Once installed run the following commands navigated to the folder you want the CHORAS frontend to live:

   ```shell
   git clone -b dev https://github.com/choras-org/frontend-v2.git
   cd frontend-v2
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Go to http://localhost:5173/ in your favourite browser and the user interface should be visible.
4. If the projects are not loaded correctly or if you have trouble creating a new project, this means that you still need to get the backend up and running. Follow the instructions [here](https://choras-backend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/includes/setup.html).
